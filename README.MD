# Youtube Clock

This simple script for GreaseMonkey / TemperMonkey just adds a clock to the Youtube control bar so that you don't have to get out of fullscreen to see what time it is.

What is working:
- Standard time display

What is planned:
- Config to show the time with / without the leading zero
- Config to switch between 12h/24h
